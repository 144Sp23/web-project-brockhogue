                <h1>About Me</h1>

                <p>I was born August 19, 2002 in Hiawatha, Kansas but was raised in Falls City, Nebraska. Growing up in a small town was fun yet difficult at times. I had an established group of friends throughout my entire childhood. In high school, I participated in many sports and activities. I was in cross country, basketball, track, show choir, band, speech, musical, and FCA. When it comes to sports I am a huge Husker fan and take Nebraska football very seriously. When it comes to basketball, I am a North carolina Tar Heels fan til the day I die. Other sports teams I am fans of are the Chiefs, Royals, and OKC Thunder. What I like to do in my spare time is workout, whether it's running or lifting, spending time with family, and playing basketball. </p>

                <h1>My Family</h1>

                <p>Like stated before, I am the youngest of three brothers in my family. I have a great understanding of being a teacher as my whole family are all teachers! My father, Don, was the Physical Education teacher at Falls City Middle School and then took the Athletic Director job in 2014. He also was the head coach for football for about 12 years and recently stepped down from the head coaching job of boys basketball after 23 years. My mother, Terri, has been teaching Middle School math for 34 years! Bless her heart. She has been coaching track for 15 years and has recently started to coach volleyball. My oldest brother, Reese, started his education career at Columbus Lakeview but has moved to Ashland-Greenwood where he coaches high school softball and girls basketball. My other older brother, Koner, just got hires at Tri County Jr./Sr. High where he teaches 6-8 PE and 9-12 PE and weights. He is the head girls basketball coach and also coaches track.</p>

                <h1>College</h1>

                <p>I attended college at Northwest Missouri State University in Maryville, Missouri. I was there for four years and got my Bachelor's degree in Business Education. I plan on getting my Master's degree in Administration through Northwest in hopes of getting an Athletic Director job in the future. I was also apart of the fraternity, Sigma Tau Gamma, where I held the Health and Wellness, Treasurer, and VP of Finance positions.</p>
